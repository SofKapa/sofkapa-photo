            <p class="padded-md margin-b-0 featured-text-bold text-center">One of the great advantages of living in Melbourne is the abundance of creative talent available.

            <p class="sm-padded text-sm">Hi, Iâ€™m Sof! A Czech-Portuguese photographer living in the land Down Under</p>
            <p class="sm-padded text-sm">My photography journey started with my passion for travel. When I was a kid my family and I moved to Cape Verde for my dad's work and, since then, the desire to discover new places and cultures has never left me</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Somewhere along my travels and life abroad, I decided to pick up a camera, but it was only during my 2-year backpacking trip around this curiously unique country, Australia, that my camera became my most powerful storytelling tool. It pushes me to be more aware of my surroundings and helps me connect with people</p>

        <div class="about-section col-5_md-9_sm-11">
            <p class="text-sm">Then covid hit and, like everyone else, I had to adapt. Traveling was not an option anymore so I started expanding my photography portfolio to venue and food photography, promoting the cafe I was working for at the time. I also took this time to learn how to code with the amazing <a class="italic" target="_blank" href="https://www.instituteofcode.com/">Institute of Code</a> to be able to build this website from scratch</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Fast forward a few years, many traveled kilometers, and a series of nerve-racking lockdowns and you can now catch me using my camera to share travel and street stories, help people immortalize special moments in their lives, and brands showcase their full potential online</p>
