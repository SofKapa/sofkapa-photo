        <p class="sm-padded text-sm">Hi, I’m Sof! A Czech-Portuguese photographer living in the land Down Under</p>
        <p class="sm-padded text-sm">My photography journey started with my <span class="featured">passion for travel</span> . When I was a kid my family and I moved to Cape Verde for my dad's work and, since then, the desire to discover new places and cultures has never left me. Somewhere along my travels and life abroad, I decided to pick up a camera, but it was only during my 2-year backpacking trip around Australia and its unique landscape, that my camera became my most powerful storytelling tool. It pushes me to be more aware of my surroundings and helps me connect with people</p>
