      <p class="sm-padded text-sm">Hey, I’m Sof. Czech-Portuguese, based in Melbourne, and interested in the <span class="subtle-italic">moments that don’t ask for attention — but deserve it anyway</span></p>
      <p class="sm-padded text-sm">Photography didn’t start as a career. It started as curiosity. I grew up moving countries, and somewhere between Cape Verde and what was meant to be a one-year backpacking trip around Australia, I picked up a camera and never really put it down</p>
      <p class="sm-padded text-sm">It’s how I <span class="subtle-italic">tune in</span> — with people, places and, most of all, moments</p>

        <p> Had a fantastic newborn photo shoot in the hospital two days after baby was born. Sofia was relaxed, flexible and kind making the whole experience very enjoyable. We now how fantastic memories that you would never know were captured in a hospital room </p>

      <div class="slider-item margin-b-1">
        <p> We had some newborn photos taken in hospital with Sofia and safe to say our expectations were way exceeded. The photos were lovely, lots of quality shots and you'd not know they were taken in a hospital room with next to no natural light. Also Sofia was attentive and kind, which was appreciated in our sleep deprived haze. Thank you Sofia! </p>

        <p> Sofia's professionalism and expertise shone through during our newborn photoshoot at the hospital. She handled our precious baby Senna with the utmost care, ensuring her comfort throughout the session.
