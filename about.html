        <p class="sm-padded text-sm">Hi, Iâ€™m Sof! A Czech-Portuguese photographer living in the land Down Under</p>
        <p class="sm-padded text-sm">My photography journey started with my <span class="featured">passion for travel</span> . When I was a kid my family and I moved to Cape Verde for my dad's work and, since then, the desire to discover new places and cultures has never left me. Somewhere along my travels and life abroad, I decided to pick up a camera, but it was only during my 2-year backpacking trip around Australia and its unique landscape, that my camera became my most powerful storytelling tool. It pushes me to be more aware of my surroundings and helps me connect with people</p>

      <p class="text-sm">When covid hit, like everyone else, I had to adapt. Traveling was not an option anymore so I started expanding my photography portfolio to <span class="featured">food & venue photography</span>, promoting the cafe I was working for at the time. I also took this time to learn how to code with the amazing <a class="italic" target="_blank" href="https://www.instituteofcode.com/">Institute of Code</a> to be able to build this website from scratch</p>
